# 3D Printed Case for Gas Meter Monitoring System

This repository includes designs and files for a 3D printed case used in the Gas Meter Monitoring System. The case is versatile and can serve as both a **handheld device** and a **LoRa gateway**.

## Overview

### Current Version: FDM 3D Printed Case
- **Technology**: FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printing.
- **Materials**: Designed for compatibility with common FDM materials like PLA or PETG.
- **Files Included**:
  - **Inventor Project Files**: For further customization or modifications.
  - **Parts and Assembly**: Individual components and assembly guides.
  - **STL and OBJ Files**: Ready-to-print files for most 3D printers.

### Upcoming Version: SLS 3D Printed Case
- **Technology**: SLS (Selective Laser Sintering) 3D printing.
- **Features**:
  - Enhanced structural integrity and detailed design capabilities.
  - **Custom 2-Layer PCB**: For improved circuit integration and performance.
  - **Li-ion Battery Integration**: Provides portable power support for handheld use.
- **Files to be Included**:
  - Updated Inventor Project Files.
  - STL and OBJ files optimized for SLS printing.
  - PCB 3D-model
