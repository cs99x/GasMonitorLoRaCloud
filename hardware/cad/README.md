# 3D Printed Case for Gas Meter Monitoring System

This repository should include designs and files for a 3D printed case for both a: **handheld device** and a **LoRa gateway**.

## Overview

### Current Version: FDM 3D Printed Case
- **Technology**: FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printing.
- **Materials**: Designed for compatibility with common FDM materials like PLA or PETG.
- **Files Included**:
  - **Inventor Project Files**: For further customization or modifications.
  - **Parts and Assembly**: Individual components and assembly guides.
  - **STL and OBJ Files**: Ready-to-print files for most 3D printers.

---

### Upcoming Version: SLS 3D Printed Case
- **Technology**: SLS (Selective Laser Sintering) 3D printing.
- **Features**:
  - Enhanced structural integrity and detailed design capabilities.
  - **Custom 2-Layer PCB**: For improved circuit integration and performance.
  - **Li-ion Battery Integration**: Provides portable power support for handheld use.
- **Files to be Included**:
  - Updated Inventor Project Files.
  - STL and OBJ files optimized for SLS printing.
  - PCB 3D-model

## Printing Instructions
### FDM Version
1. Load the STL files into your preferred slicing software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer).
2. Suggested print settings:
   - **Layer Height**: 0.2mm.
   - **Infill**: 100%.
3. Use appropriate filament like PLA or PETG.

### SLS Version (Coming Soon)
- Better surface quality as well as fitting.
- More ergonomic casing.
- Final STL files will be optimized for powder-based printing.
---

## Assembly Instructions
- **Included Files**:
  - Individual parts with clear labeling.
- **Hardware Required**:
  - Screws and fasteners (refer to the assembly guide for specifications).
  - Li-ion battery and PCB (for the upcoming SLS version).

---

## Future Plans
- Integration of advanced features for the SLS version:
  - Enhanced durability and reduced weight.
  - Improved internal layout for easier assembly and maintenance.
