\section{Vision}{

The system should detect multiple harmful gases in real-time and wireless transmit the measured values to a cloud backend and displays them visual (without line of sight).
}



\section{features and capabilities}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Portable handheld device capable of measuring multiple harmful gases.
  \item Displaying gas concentrations to the user directly on the handheld device.
  \item Real-time transmission of measured gas data via long-range wireless communication (LoRa).
  \item Receiving transmitted data and forwarding it to a smartphone via Bluetooth using a LoRa-Bluetooth gateway.
  \item Sending the received data to a cloud back-end for further processing and storage.
  \item Implementing a web interface to display real-time and historical gas measurements.
\end{itemize}
